              How important are natural ecosystems to mankind? Well, if we ask
              this question in the United States we would get a wide range of
              different answers. To some people natural ecosystems and nature in
              general is the most important aspect of our world. To other people
              in the country, nature is not important at all, if we look at the
              article “How Much Nature Should America Keep?”, we are able to see
              both sides of the story. Lee-Ashley claims that “Every 30 seconds,
              a football field worth of America’s natural areas disappears to
              roads, houses, pipelines, and other development.” (Lee-Ashley).
              The sad reality of America’s views on nature is that we seem focus
              more on development, than the preservation of nature. Now while
              this is a sad reality for most of Americans’ there are still a
              portion of America that understands the necessity of preserving
              our natural ecosystems. One of the most important figures in
              American Conservation was Theodore Roosevelt, from a young age he
              was fascinated by nature and the wildlife in it. As president
              Roosevelt used his power to establish 150 national forests, 51
              federal bird reserves, four national game preserves, five
              nationals parks and 18 national monuments on over 230 million
              acres of public land. Roosevelt did many great things for
              conservation while he was president, however he also inspired
              following generations to understand the beauty and necessity of
              nature. While the United States is a country of beautiful nature,
              we are also, a large player in agriculture. In the United States
              about 40 percent of the land is used for agriculture in one form
              or another. Most of this farmland is used by small farms almost 91
              percent, and the remaining 9 percent is occupied by large farms.
              These numbers help us realize just how important agriculture is in
              the United States. While development is overtaking too much land
              of natural ecosystems and agriculture, we are still able to see
              how important both are in the scope of beauty and necessity.
              Lee-Ashley expresses the opinion that it is necessary for the
              United States to retain 30 percent of all land for natural
              ecosystems and agricultural purposes

              Why are some plants regarded as "good" while some are regarded as
              "bad"? What makes a plant good or bad? Growing up around farming
              and ranching in west central Nebraska, I was introduced to this
              idea of a good or a bad plant at a young age. One of the worst
              plants that I remember is Canada Thistle. So naturally I asked the
              question of why it was bad, well when I was younger no one gave me
              a straight answer, but as I dug into why it was considered bad I
              found lots of material on why it is bad. The general sentiment
              surrounding Canada Thistle is that it is a very bad weed, being
              labeled as Noxious in at least 35 other states (Wilson). Why is
              Canada Thistle noxious? Canada thistle invades natural areas such
              as prairies, savannas, glades and dunes if some degree of
              disturbance already exists. Once established Canada Thistle
              spreads quickly, replacing native plants. It has high dispersal
              rates and can remain viable in the soil for up to 20 years
              (Carelton). Reine describes Canada Thistle as one of Canada's
              nastier pests. I really tried to find any sort of sentiment around
              Canada Thistle that was even slightly positive. In the search for
              positivity surrounding this plant I did come across the edibility
              of thistle. Elpel talks about the tastiness of a young Canada
              Thistle's leaves, he talks about the nutritional value that Canada
              Thistle has, however outside of this and very few medicinal
              applications, Canada Thistle is still regarded as a very bad weed
              that needs to be controlled (Elpel's).

              Knowing the views around nature and agriculture, and the views
              surrounding Canada Thistle allows us to make some connections
              between the United States viewpoints and our ability to address
              the invasive species. When thinking of the social aspects of our
              "wicked problem" the first thing that comes to mind is how does
              the problem directly impact society, however in this case Canada
              Thistle doesn't necessarily directly impact society. The plant
              does not directly impact human health, as seen in the views on it,
              it is believed to be nutritional if consumed. Where the impact
              does take place however is, in the impact the thistle has on
              natural ecosystems and agriculture. Thistle has the capability to
              spared very aggressively and push out native species, which can be
              and often is very detrimental to natural ecosystems. When it comes
              to agriculture Canada Thistle is also very damaging, it tends to
              take over plowed lands (Elpel). Canada Thistle effects more than
              just land however it is harmful to livestock and wildlife. How
              does knowing the negative impacts of Canada Thistle help us to
              understanding the interactions between the viewpoints in America
              and addressing the problem of Canada Thistle? We saw earlier that
              even though a lot of land is wiped out for development purposes,
              there is still a lot people that hold the view that nature and
              agriculture is vitally important. When looking into nature and
              natural ecosystems, we are interested mostly in the beauty of it.
              So in the 30 some states where Canada Thistle is identified as a
              noxious weed we are trying to maintain the natural beauty by
              managing the species. So what is involved in the management of the
              species, well to simplify it, a lot of time and money. What I am
              most concerned with is the time, as a teenager I would spend many
              of my weekends helping a family friend cut out thistle plants
              which never solved the problem it just kept it under control. This
              is what makes the Canada Thistle a wicked problem, no matter what
              solution you try to implement, you are never really solving the
              problem you are just controlling it for a period. I don't know if
              the last example is a great to show the social aspects of Canada
              Thistle. Canada Thistle in the United States doesn't have the
              social implications of sending our society into poverty or civil
              unrest but the implications that it does have is costing many
              farmers and ranchers’ hours and hours of time trying to control
              it. Ranchers must remove it not just because in most states it is
              a noxious species but because cattle will not eat it, ultimately
              causing ranchers precious pastureland. Farmers must remove it
              because if it over grows a plowed field the crop being planted
              will most likely not grow. The ultimate interaction between Canada
              Thistle and our viewpoints on natural ecosystems and agriculture
              is that Canada Thistle is a threat to our most valuable resource
              which is our nature and agriculture. Since Canada Thistle is a
              threat we must do everything in our power to control it. An
              important question to ask is how we can control this wicked
              problem, without infringing on our viewpoints. We must take
              precautions when attempting to control the problem without making
              new problems, we don't want to introduce a new species to kill of
              thistle and have the new species, we don't want to try to kill it
              with a chemical that just makes everything in a pasture inedible.
              Canada Thistle threatens our viewpoints and we must control it
              without causing more wicked problems.
